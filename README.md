# BP-Neural-Network
The BP Neural Network can be used in regression prediction
I coded the BP network in Python 3.7 version without using any framework and successfully established a tracking car wheel angle speed prediction model by it
In general, you can use this code to address any regression probelm, because I canceled activation funciton in the last layer
